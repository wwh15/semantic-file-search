This is a Semantic Podcast Search Engine
Created by William He, Peter Liu, Steven Peng for the 2023 Duke Code for Good Hackathon

Utilizing React, Flask, and text embedding with SentenceTransformers, we developed a search engine that will take a search query and return top podcasts that are relevant to the search query.
